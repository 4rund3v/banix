      "Really cool for it. Put for my 49 inch TV. The light is more than enough. I had put it between. Although you have to put a tape and stick the remote side of the wire on the TV or it might hang and later on the lights sticker might come off slowly. Go for it beautiful ambient lighting. There are many colors and different modes you can set accordingly to your liking. Its better to buy this without the seperate remote because those might get spoilt later and you can't change the modes. My only hope is this won't get spoilt later since there not like the philips lights. The sticker is not strong enough you have to use double side tape.",

      "I bought the 1 meter version for my 24 inch monitor. Initially the brightness was too high, adjusted the brightness by moving the monitor a little far from the wall and it looks pretty damn good.",

      "1. Many colors to choose from with different modes.\n2. It has 8 level of light intensity. I have included pics if that helps anyone (brightest and dimmest level).\n      3. Sticks well on my monitor that has glossy finish on the back (Dell s2216H).\n      4. They are great to reduce eye strain if you use your computer in dark room or at night with no lights.\n      5. USB wire is long enough if you don't keep your USB source far.\n      6. Clutter-less.",
